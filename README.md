The code in the `osc_body_joint_transmitter` is based on [an official Kinect sample project](https://github.com/microsoft/Azure-Kinect-Samples/tree/master/body-tracking-samples/simple_3d_viewer). I have modified the original code to share the position of the body joints with Supercolider.

The Supercolider scripts are in the scripts folder.

This project is under development. If you would like to discuss the project me please email me at <latassi@ucsd.edu>.
